Md. Alim Al Razy is an AI Specialist with deep expertise in NLP, machine learning, and scalable software systems. With a background in electrical engineering and hands-on leadership in LLM finetuning, game AI, and anomaly detection, he engineers intelligent systems that serve real-world needs.

Currently at Bulipe Tech (May 2025–Present), Md. Alim is building a prompt-to-game generator that lets users create functional games from natural language. This system uses a lightweight LLM to parse scene logic and auto-generate executable Pygame code, expanding game development access for non-programmers. He also developed an AI-powered grading assistant that applies transformer-based semantic models and rubric-based scoring to evaluate student answers—fine-tuned on QA datasets for fairness and accuracy.

As a Full-Stack Developer at AI MSP (Mar 2025–May 2025, Remote), he built a behavioral anomaly detection engine using Z-score baselining, geo-velocity checks, and unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest, K-Means). He integrated HR context, threat feeds, and suppression logic to reduce false positives—bolstering alert quality in high-volume log environments.

Previously at Devolved AI (Dec 2023–Apr 2025), Md. Alim led chatbot development by finetuning Yi-34b, LLaMA 2, and GPT-3.5-turbo, enabling real-time web retrieval, historical memory via LangChain, and API-enhanced information extraction. He also trained a custom LLM from scratch using hybrid parallelism on multi-GPU clusters, optimized model adaptability via fine-tuning, and handled massive-scale preprocessing in Spark—cleaning, normalizing, and debiasing datasets.

Earlier, at O’Dell Tech (Jul 2022–Nov 2023), he engineered a BERT-powered support chatbot that cut manual task loads by 50%, and developed a Bangla character detection system using CNN and GAN networks with 96% accuracy—paving the way for OCR and digital transformation in regional scripts.

He holds a B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from BRAC University (2019). As the first author of a research paper on silver nanoparticle synthesis and UV-VIS spectroscopy, he contributed to a research cited 55+ times, underscoring his analytical and interdisciplinary skills.

Md. Alim is a Bronze Medalist in the International Youth Math Challenge (IYMC), ranking in the top 20% globally.
